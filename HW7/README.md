The Home Task can be done using Typescript or Vanilla JS.

Job runner
As an implementation of this home task you should create circular job runner using a priority queue. 
Each job must have a priority and should be run according to it. 
Priority could be set by randomizer. 
Job result is insignificant in terms of the homework, for example it could be logging of jobâ€™s priority in console. 
Job runner must handle at least 10000 jobs without noticeable performance issues.

Evaluation criteria:
2. Job runner is not implemented at all.
3. The job runner is implemented, but priority queue is implemented incorrectly.
4. The priority queue is implemented but could be improved.
5. The job runner is implemented correctly; no issues are present. Code is documented as needed.
